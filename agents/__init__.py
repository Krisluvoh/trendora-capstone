"""
The three Trendora agents: Intake, Research, and Recommendation.

Each module in this package defines one agent's system prompt and wires it
to its output schema. Shared plumbing (prompt building, JSON parsing,
validation, retry) lives in base_agent.py; the individual agent files are
intentionally thin, since a prompt plus a schema is all that distinguishes
one agent from another.

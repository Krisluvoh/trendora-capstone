Shared machinery for every Trendora agent:
  - injects memory context into the prompt
  - forces strict JSON-only output
  - parses + validates the response against a pydantic schema
  - retries once on malformed JSON (LLMs occasionally wrap JSON in prose
    or code fences despite instructions — handle it rather than crash)
